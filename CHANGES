    Severe bug found:  Differing files of equal size had not been
    reported.

    Dependency libavlbst is now optional, tsearch can be used in-
    stead.

    files.

Release 1.1.0
=============

2016-02-12

    Bugfix 1:  If two files to compare had zero size they had
    been assumed to be equal.  This does not make sense for char-
    acter or block devices.

    Bugfix 2:  Using a dangling symbolic link as a command line
    argument did lead to an error, no compare had been done.

    Functional change:

    Since the purpose of rlcmp is to test the equality of two
    files or directories which are expected to be equal, it did
    stop the compare of a file when the first difference was
    found.  If e.g. the file attributes are tested and one check
    fails, other attribute and the file contents are not com-
    pared.  So the diagnostic messages are showing less differ-
    ence then actually may exist.  Altough this was intended (to
    speed up the tool) it may not be what the user expects.

    Now the following changes had been done:

     - At first the file contents are tested.  If there is a
       difference the file attribute test is skipped.  (The files
       may have nothing in common, so the user is not interested
       in e.g. modification time differences.)

     - If the file contents are equal always all attributes are
       tested.

     - The actual file attribute difference is printed.
