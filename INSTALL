1. Dependencies

  Before building rlcmp the shared library libavlbst needs to  be
  installed.   Installation instructions are found on the project
  page https://github.com/n-t-roff/libavlbst.


2. Configuration

  The installation  paths  can  be  configured  in  the  makefile
  "in.mk".  There are four paths configureable:

     BINDIR   Directory for the tool itself
     MANDIR   Directory for the man page
     INCDIR   Directory of the AVL library include files
     LIBDIR   Directory of the AVL library


3. Installation

  The tool is build with the command

     $ make

  Installation usually has to be done as root:

     # make install

  Generated files are removed with

     $ make clean


4. Deinstallation

  Deinstallation is done as root with

     # make uninstall
