1. Dependencies

  It  is  suggested  to  install  the speed optimized AVL library
  libavlbst.  Installation instructions are found on the  project
  page https://github.com/n‐t‐roff/libavlbst.


2. Configuration

  The  installation  paths  can  be  configured  in  the makefile
  "in.mk".  There are four paths configureable:

     BINDIR   Directory for the tool itself
     MANDIR   Directory for the man page
     INCDIR   Directory of the AVL library include files
     LIBDIR   Directory of the AVL library


3. Installation

  The tool is build with the commands:

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  Installation usually has to be done as root:

     # make install

  Generated files are removed with

     $ make distclean


4. Deinstallation

  At first a makefile needs to be generated with

     $ ./configure

  Deinstallation is done as root with

     # make uninstall

  Then the generated makefile is removed with

     $ make distclean
