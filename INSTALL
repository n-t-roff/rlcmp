1. Dependencies

  It is suggested to install  the  speed  optimized  AVL  library
  libavlbst.   Installation instructions are found on the project
  page https://github.com/n-t-roff/libavlbst.


2. Configuration

  The installation  paths  can  be  configured  in  the  makefile
  "in.mk".  There are four paths configureable:

     BINDIR   Directory for the tool itself
     MANDIR   Directory for the man page
     INCDIR   Directory of the AVL library include files
     LIBDIR   Directory of the AVL library

  Further it is possible to configure using  mmap(2)  instead  of
  read(2) by removing the comment in the line

     MMAP= #-DMMAP_MEMCMP

  but normally read(2) is faster.


3. Installation

  The tool is build with the commands:

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  Installation usually has to be done as root:

     # make install

  Generated files are removed with

     $ make distclean


4. Deinstallation

  At first a makefile needs to be generated with

     $ ./configure

  Deinstallation is done as root with

     # make uninstall

  Then the generated makefile is removed with

     $ make distclean
